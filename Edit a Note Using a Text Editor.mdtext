Title:  Edit a Note Using a Text Editor

You can, of course, edit your Notes right within Notenik, on the Edit tab. But there may be times when it is more convenient to use another application to edit a Note file. Since your Notes are stored as simple text files, any text editor can be used (TextEdit, BBEdit, etc.) You can navigate to the Note of interest using the Finder, and then open the Note from there, in your default text editor, or any other text editing app (or specialized Markdown editor, for that matter). But there is an easier way! Simply select Text Edit Note beneath the Note menu -- or use the keyboard shortcut Cmd-T -- and your currently selected Note will be opened in your default text editor! You can just view your Note here, to see how the file is actually formatted, or you can make changes to it here. If you make changes, though, remember to save and close the file when you are done and then, when you come back to Notenik, use Reload Note beneath the Note menu -- or just enter Cmd-J -- in order to see your changes reflected within Notenik.
